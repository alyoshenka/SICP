When using the square procedure, the value to be squared
is only calculated once, while when using an explicit
multiplication it must be calculated twice.

Every time expmod is called with an even exponent, two more
expmod calls are spawned. This makes it so the algorithms time
takes a linearly increasing amount of time to complete: O(n)

O(log(2^n)) = O(n * log2) = O(n)
